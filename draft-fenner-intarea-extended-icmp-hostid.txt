                 Extending ICMP for Node Identification
            draft-fenner-intarea-extended-icmp-hostid-latest

Abstract

   RFC5837 describes a mechanism for Extending ICMP for Interface and
   Next-Hop Identification, which allows providing additional
   information in an ICMP error that helps identify interfaces
   participating in the path.  This is especially useful in environments
   where each interface may not have a unique IP address to respond to,
   e.g., a traceroute.

   This document introduces a similar ICMP extension for Node
   Identification.  It allows providing a unique IP address and/or a
   textual name for the node, in the case where each node may not have a
   unique IP address (e.g., the IPv6 nexthop deployment case described
   in draft-chroboczek-intarea-v4-via-v6).

1.  Introduction

   In addition to adding incoming interface information to a traceroute
   using the mechanisms described in [RFC5837], a network operator may
   be interested in adding information to identify nodes themselves.
   [I-D.chroboczek-intarea-v4-via-v6] describes a scenario in which
   individual nodes do not have unique IPv4 addresses to use to reply to
   an IPv4 traceroute, so additional information is needed.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Node Identification Object

   This section defines the Node Identification Object, an ICMP
   Extension Object with a Class-Num (Object Class Value) of 5 that can
   be appended to the following messages:

   *  ICMPv4 Time Exceeded

   *  ICMPv4 Destination Unreachable

   *  ICMPv4 Parameter Problem

   *  ICMPv6 Time Exceeded

   *  ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable

   For reasons described in [RFC4884], this extension cannot be appended
   to any of the currently defined ICMPv4 or ICMPv6 messages other than
   those listed above.

   The extension defined herein MAY be appended to any of the above
   listed messages and SHOULD be appended whenever required to identify
   the node and when local policy or security considerations do not
   supersede this requirement.

   Similarly to the Interface Identification Object defined in
   [RFC5837], there are two different pieces of information that can
   appear in a Node Information Object.

   1.  An IP Address Sub-Object MAY be included, containing an address
       of sufficient scope to identify the node within the domain.  The
       IP Address Sub-Object is defined in Section 3.2 of this memo.

   2.  A Node Name Sub-Object MAY be included, as specified in
       Section 3.3, containing up to 63 octets of the yang sys:hostname
       or another appropriate name uniquely identifying the node.

3.1.  C-Type Meaning in a Node Identification Object

   The C-Type contains a bitmask describing what information is included
   in this Node Identification Object.

   Bit     0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7
       +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
       |               Reserved                | IPAddr|  name | Rsvd2 |
       +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

            Figure 1: C-Type for the Node Identification Object

   The following are bit-field definitions for C-Type:

   Reserved (bits 0-4): These bits are reserved for future use and MUST
   be set to 0 on transmit and ignored on receipt.

   IP Addr (bit 5) : When set, a Node IP Address Sub-Object is present.
   When clear, an IP Address Sub-Object is not present.  The Node IP
   Address Sub-Object is described in Section 3.2 of this memo.

   Node Name (bit 6): When set, a Node Name Sub-Object is included.
   When clear, it is not included.  The Node Name Sub-Object is
   described in Section 3.3 of this memo.

   Rsvd2 (bit 7): This bit is reserved for future use and MUST be set to
   0 on transmit and ignored on receipt.

   The information included does not self-identify, so this
   specification defines a specific ordering for sending the information
   that must be followed.

   If bit 5 (IP Address) is set, a Node IP Address Sub-Object MUST be
   sent first.  If bit 6 (Name) is set, a Node Name Sub-Object MUST be
   sent next.  The information order is thus: IP Address Sub-Object,
   Node Name Sub-Object.  Any or all pieces of information may be
   present or absent, as indicated by the C-Type.  Any data that follows
   these optional pieces of information MUST be ignored.

   It is valid (though pointless until additional bits are assigned by
   IANA) to receive a Node Information Object where bits 5 and 6 are
   both 0; this MUST NOT generate a warning or error.

3.2.  Node IP Address Sub-Object

   If the Node Identification Object identifies the node by address, the
   Object Payload contains an address sufficient to identify the node
   within the appropriate scope - global or as otherwise configured - as
   depicted in Figure 2.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              AFI              |            Reserved           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                           Address...

          Figure 2: Node Identification Object - C-Type 2 Payload

   Payload fields are defined as follows:

   *  Address Family Identifier (AFI): This 16-bit field identifies the
      type of address represented by the Address field.  Values for this
      field represent a subset of values found in the IANA registry of
      Address Family Numbers (available from
      [IANA.address-family-numbers]).  Valid values are 1 (representing
      a 32-bit IPv4 address) and 2 (representing a 128-bit IPv6
      address).

   *  Reserved: This field MUST be set to 0 and ignored upon receipt.

   *  Address: This variable-length field represents an address of
      appropriate scope (global, if none other defined) that can be used
      to identify the node.

3.3.  Node Name Sub-Object

   Figure 3 depicts the Node Name Sub-Object:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Length    |                  Node Name...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         Figure 3: Node Identification Object Node Name Sub-Object

   The Node Name Sub-Object MUST have a length that is a multiple of 4
   octets and MUST NOT exceed 64 octets.

   The Length field represents the length of the Node Name Sub- Object,
   including the length and the node name in octets.  The maximum valid
   length is 64 octets.  The length is constrained to ensure there is
   space for the start of the original packet and additional
   information.

   The second field contains the human-readable node name.  The node
   name SHOULD be the sys:hostname [RFC7317], if less than 64 octets, or
   the first 63 octets of the sys:hostname, if the sys:hostname is
   longer.  The node name MAY be some other human-meaningful name of the
   node.  The node name MUST be padded with ASCII NUL characters if the
   object would not otherwise terminate on a 4-octet boundary.

   The node name MUST be represented in the UTF-8 charset [RFC3629]
   using the Default Language [RFC2277].

4.  Security Considerations

   It may not be desirable to allow this information to be sent to an
   arbitrary receiver.  The addition of this information SHOULD be
   configurable, and MUST default to off.  An implementation SHOULD
   determine what objects may be appended to a given message based on
   the destination IP address of the ICMP message that will contain the
   objects.

   The intended field of use for the extensions defined in this document
   is administrative debugging and troubleshooting.  The extensions
   herein defined supply additional information in ICMP responses.
   These mechanisms are not intended to be used in non-debugging
   applications.

   This document does not specify an authentication mechanism for the
   extension that it defines.  Application developers should be aware
   that ICMP messages and their contents are easily spoofed.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This IANA has allocated the ICMP Extension Object Class value 5 to
   the extension described above.  The corresponding Class Sub-types
   Registry is as follows:

        +================+===========================+===========+
        | C-Type (Value) | Description               | Reference |
        +================+===========================+===========+
        | 0-4            | Unallocated - allocatable | [This     |
        |                | with Standards Action     | document] |
        +----------------+---------------------------+-----------+
        | 5              | IP Address Sub-object     | [This     |
        |                | included                  | document] |
        +----------------+---------------------------+-----------+
        | 6              | Name Sub-object included  | [This     |
        |                |                           | document] |
        +----------------+---------------------------+-----------+
        | 7              | Unallocated - allocatable | [This     |
        |                | with Standards Action     | document] |
        +----------------+---------------------------+-----------+

Appendix A.  Change history

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

A.1.  Changes since draft-fenner-intarea-extended-icmp-hostid-00

   *  Instead of having two different messages with the same Class Value
      and different CType values, we copy the bitmap implementation from
      [RFC5837].  The re-use of bit positions means that packet parsing
      and generation code can be largely reused from existing [RFC5837]
      code.

A.2.  Changes since draft-fenner-intarea-extended-icmp-hostid-01

   *  Fixed several copy-pasta errors that still referred to interface
      names instead of node name.

Acknowledgments

   This document derives text heavily from [RFC5837], since the
   underlying mechanism is identical, and only the semantics of the
   message differs.  Thanks are therefore due to that document's
